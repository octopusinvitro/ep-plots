# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server
# process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: Everypolitician Plots

description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This site is the result of teaching myself how to use web technologies (HTML,
  CSS, JS, SVG, etc.) to make interactive plots. The dataset used for the plots
  is taken from the EveryPolitician project.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url:     "http://epplots.tk" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
