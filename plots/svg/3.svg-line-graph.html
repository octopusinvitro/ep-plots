title: 3. SVG line graph with polyline
description: Applied to
layout: page
---
    <p>SVG has a very convenient element for line plots out of the box: <code>polyline</code>.<br>
      In its <code>points</code> attribute, we can store the data to plot.<br>
      The Y axis grows from the top down though, as opposed to a normal plot.

    <p>Plot is a WIP yet! sorry! For now, enjoy a placeholder :)</p>
